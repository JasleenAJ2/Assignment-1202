## Project Title 
Drug Classification Using Machine Learning

## Short Description 
This approach involves categorizing drugs based on age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio. The dataset is assessed and modeled with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes algorithms.

## Getting Started
This part describes the basic guidelines on how to launch the project on the local environment.

## Prerequisites
Libraries:
```
pandas
numPy
matplotlib
Scikit-learn
```
## Installing 
```
pip install Numpy 
pip install Pandas
pip install matplotib
```

## Running the Tests

Using the data, the Python script works the application of the SVM and Naive Bayes models.
Download the data set in the project folder and rename it as drugdataset.csv.
Run the Python script on jupiter notebook

## Breakdown of testing

It will also be divided into training and testing data set.
Features are normalized by using StandardScaler.
That is why, the work involves training, testing and evaluating of SVM and Naive Bayes models.
The findings include the confusion matrices and the categorization reports.

## Deployment
This project was intended for teaching purposes, not deployment.
